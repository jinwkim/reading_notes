## Chapter 1 - Critiquing Design

### Approach to critiquing product design
* Reveal ~3 design criteria
* Explain how product may or may not meet your criteria
* Offer concrete evidence and contrast with similar products if possible

## Ten Principles of Good Design by Dieter Rams
1. **Innovative**
2. **Makes a product useful**
3. Aesthetic
4. **Understandable**
5. Unobtrusive
6. **Honest**
7. Long-lasting
8. Thorough down to the last detail
9. Environmentally friendly
10. As little design as possible

### Practice Questions
#### Do you like LinkedIn’s endorsement feature?
* Establish the 3 criteria upfront
* Walk the user through features, don’t assume interviewer’s product knowledge. They may challenge your wrong assumptions; set a common ground as you walk them through the features and “assumptions” you want to use

#### Tell me about a product you like and use frequently. Why do you like it?
* Justify your explanations with evidence

#### Tell me about a product that was designed poorly.
* Choose unique products
* Don’t diss the iPhone at an Apple interview



## Chapter 2 - Designing a Desktop Application

### Tips
* Embrace the unknown, enjoy the design process

### CIRCLES Method
* Comprehend the situation
* Report the customer’s needs
* Cut, through prioritization
* List solutions
* Evaluate trade-offs
* Summarize your recommendation

#### Comprehend the Situation
* Context - avoid miscommunication, ensure you and interviewer have the same mental model
    * **What is it?**
    * **Who is it for?**
    * **Why do they need it?**
    * **How does it work?**
    * When is it available?
    * Where is it available?
* Goals and Metrics
    * I.e. revenue, user acquisition/retention, market share, customer satisfaction, conversion rate
* Constraints and Assumptions
    * When asked to design something, ask about constraints and what assumptions you can make
    * I.e. deadlines, resources, platform, scalability

#### Identify the Customer
* Focus on particular potential customer personas, don’t overreach
* Create a 2x2 matrix to clarity and visualize potential customer persona
    * Who? Behaviors, demographics, needs and goals

#### Report the Customer’s Needs
* “As a <role >, I want <goal > so that <benefit >”
* Identify a few

#### Cut, Through Prioritization
* Show how to prioritize by assessing trade-offs and making decisions
* Use a prioritization matrix to organize - consider revenue, customer satisfaction, ease of implementation, and overall
* RICE method for prioritization criteria
    * Reach - how many people will be impacted?
    * Impact - what is the benefit of that user story? Low or high?
    * Confidence - what’s the probability of success?
    * Effort - how much time will our take?
* RICE score = R*I*C/E, use like ROI related metric
* Ultimate goal is to see how much benefit you get per unit of investment

#### List Solutions
* Reversal method
    * Start from reversing situation
* Attribute method
    * List all product attributes, mix and match to get interesting new combos
* Why? Method
    * Challenge status quo, think outside of conventional box
* Showcase creativity, don’t just “me too” (create new Amazon) or integrate (YouTube with Android as Google PM)
* Demonstrate your future looking trends, how to benefit company
* Innovation is an iterative process, brainstorm at least 10 ideas - first ideas tend to be unoriginal and not innovative

#### Evaluate Trade-Offs
* Discuss pros and cons to your top 3 solutions, or use specified trade-off criteria (i.e. customer satisfaction, implementation difficulty, revenue potential)
* Demonstrate analytical driven mindset, objective

#### Summarize Your Recommendation
* 20-30 second summary of proposal
* What product/feature do you recommend?
* Recap and describe benefits to user/company
* Explain why this solution over others
* Next actions to explore this idea?

### Practice Question

#### How would you improve Microsoft PowerPoint?
* Example of applying CIRCLES method in real-life interview
