# Mastering the Complex Sale
Author: Jeff Thull
Key points from reading

## Notes
* Era 3 - commoditization vs complexity
* We need to help customers fully understand the problems and opportunities they face (27)
    * Dry Runs - result of customers not understanding, can’t make high-quality decision
    * “The real problem is they don’t have a process that can help them to make sense of their situation and then connect it to the right solution” (28)
        * i.e. Keep up with CMS mandates to help customers see what they might be forgetting
        * Show them how ISC helps them meet immediate needs, stay future proof
* They [customers] recognize that they may have a problem, but they don’t have a clear understanding of what that problem entails, the risk they face, or how the solutions in the market can resolve it (40)
* People retain only about 30 percent of what they hear (41)
    * Rote presentations are like lectures, they are boring
    * Devote the presentation to focus on the customer’s current situation/problem, instead of describing our products
* Leaving the customer to make these connections on their own is a perfect recipe for self-commoditization (43) => when all competitors have similar sounding presentations
    * DEDICATE TIME TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE CUSTOMER IS COMING FROM
    * DON’T FALL INTO THE PRESENTATION TRAP - focus on the customer’s world
* They [top-performing salespeople] don’t rely on conventional selling techniques and they rarely follow their company’s standard sales processes. They are not using their company’s sales brochures and other collateral, reciting prepared pitches and presenting, or manipulating customers in an overt effort to close sales… they have developed a personal approach to selling and communication through a long period of trial-and-error experimentation (51-52)
* Commoditization encourages customers to ignore value in the quest for the lowest price (55)
    * Don’t make value a buzzword
* “Prime” Process (57)
    * Discover, Diagnose, Design, Deliver
    * Diagnose - We reinforce that credibility by refusing to alter the customer’s reality to fit our own needs

* Teach customers what questions they should be asking potential vendors to help them make quality decisions (61)

## Potential Sales Process
* Who we are
* What verticals
* When - history
* Where - everywhere
* Why - CMS mandates, faltering competitor products, need to simplify number of vendors
